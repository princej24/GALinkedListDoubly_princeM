# GALinkedListDoubly_princeM

A doubly linked list has a connection to the node next and previous; it is used in dynamic storage and manipulation of elements. It only has a one-way connection, making it hard to connect to previous nodes, though it is more efficient in memory arrays, which have constant access to index hash tables and efficient lookup operations. doubly has the upper hand when it comes to dynamic operations because both ends of the list are essential.
